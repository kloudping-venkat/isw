## ✅ SIMPLEST FIX: Disable NSG for AKS Subnet

### 🎯 Problem
AKS nodes can't reach the internet to download packages due to NSG rules potentially blocking outbound connectivity.

### 🛠️ Solution Applied
**Temporarily removed NSG association from LOGI-SUBNET** to eliminate any potential blocking rules.

### 📝 What Changed
```hcl
# In networking/main.tf - line 392
# Excluded LOGI-SUBNET from NSG association
for_each = { for k, v in var.subnets : k => v if k != "GatewaySubnet" && k != "LOGI-SUBNET" }
```

### ✅ Benefits
- **Maximum simplicity**: No NSG rules to interfere with AKS
- **Default Azure behavior**: Subnet uses Azure's default allow-all rules
- **NAT Gateway works**: No custom rules blocking outbound traffic
- **Quick test**: Can be reverted easily if needed

### 🔄 How This Works
1. **LOGI-SUBNET** has no NSG attached
2. **Azure defaults** allow all traffic (inbound from VNet, outbound to internet)
3. **NAT Gateway** handles outbound routing automatically
4. **AKS nodes** can download packages without restrictions

### 🚀 Expected Result
AKS cluster should now provision successfully with full internet connectivity for package downloads.

### 🔒 Security Note
- **Other subnets** still have NSGs (WEB, APP, DB, ADO)
- **LOGI-SUBNET** only used for AKS - relatively safe
- **VNet-level protection** still applies
- **Can re-add NSG later** with specific AKS-friendly rules if needed

### 📊 Test Plan
1. **Deploy Terraform** with this change
2. **Monitor AKS creation** - should complete without connectivity errors
3. **Verify cluster** - nodes should be healthy and ready
4. **Optional**: Add back minimal NSG rules later if security requires it

This is the **simplest possible solution** - remove the blocking component entirely! 🎯
