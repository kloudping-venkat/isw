echo "‚úÖ APPROACH: Load Balancer Outbound (Most Reliable for AKS)"
echo ""

echo "üîß CONFIGURATION APPLIED:"
echo "1. Outbound Type: loadBalancer"
echo "2. Load Balancer SKU: standard"  
echo "3. Managed Outbound IPs: 1"
echo "4. Route Table: Disabled"
echo "5. Availability Zones: Removed (no AZ for CS environment)"
echo ""

echo "üìÅ FILES MODIFIED:"
echo "- terraform/main.tf: Added load balancer outbound config"
echo "- terraform/modules/em/aks/main.tf: Updated AKS module with LB settings"
echo "- terraform/modules/em/aks/variables.tf: Added load balancer variables"
echo ""

echo "üéØ EXPECTED RESULT:"
echo "- AKS creates Standard Load Balancer with outbound rules"
echo "- Azure provisions managed public IP for outbound traffic"
echo "- Nodes can download packages during provisioning"
echo "- Container image pulls work correctly"
echo "- No dependency on NAT Gateway for AKS connectivity"
echo ""

echo "üí∞ COST IMPACT:"
echo "- 1 additional public IP for AKS Load Balancer (~$3/month)"
echo "- Standard Load Balancer data processing charges apply"
echo "- NAT Gateway still used for VM subnets (cost unchanged)"
echo ""

echo "üîÑ NEXT STEPS:"
echo "1. Run terraform plan to verify configuration"
echo "2. Run terraform apply with customImportList empty"
echo "3. Monitor AKS cluster creation progress"
echo "4. Verify outbound connectivity once cluster is ready"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ This is the most reliable approach for AKS outbound connectivity!"
echo "   Load Balancer outbound is Azure's recommended method for production AKS."
